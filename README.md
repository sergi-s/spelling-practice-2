# Spelling Practice 2.0

## Overview
This project began as a hackathon entry focused on creating a recommendation system to help users with words they find difficult to spell. It has since evolved into an over engineered project, designed to explore and implement new technologies, and practice them.

We use Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Gemini and Gemma:2b to generate sentences:
1. Randomly
2. Based on words the user finds hard to spell
3. Based on a specific topic (e.g., sports)

The project has been built twice:
1. **Next.js**
2. **Angular + Java**
